        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Chicken and Sausage gumbo is a South Louisiana staple. The moment the weather dips below
            80 degrees, you can hear the distant clanging of magnalite pots getting pulled out and fired up.
            If you don't have a magnalite, any large non-stick pot will do.</p>

            
        </h3>
